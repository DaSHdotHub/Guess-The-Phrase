    I also used Google Dev-tools to test the sites responsivness by emulating the apps appearance across other device screen sizes.

    At the time of testing, the site was fully responsive across Chrome, Firefox and Safari browsers on all of the above devices with the exeption of the following:

    * The Promethean Activboard would not display box items correctly in the Chromium web browser.

    * The site would not load box images or display correctly on the older iPad2 running ios 9.

    * The site is not practically useable on mobile devices in landscape mode.
